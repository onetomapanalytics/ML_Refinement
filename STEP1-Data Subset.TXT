
STEP-1 Using the code below, the data was subset to keep patient with a predictied mortality probability of >=0.50.
This step was repeated on the yearly files from 2012-2019, the outcome variable was also created in this step,

*Project Emergency Surgeries NISQIP

*File name and path 
use "Z:\acs_nsqip_puf19.dta"

*Taking a look at the number of admission where the mortality probability is >= 0.50 and keeping only admission that match this criteria 
rename *, upper

drop if MORTPROB  == . 

count if MORTPROB >= 0.50 
*1780

keep if MORTPROB >= 0.50 
*1780

tab DISCHDEST

*From the discharge status variable, dropping if the discharge status was hospice, unknown or NULL
					   
drop if DISCHDEST == "Hospice" | DISCHDEST == "Unknown" | DISCHDEST == "NULL" | DISCHDEST == "Against Medical Advice (AMA)" 

tab DISCHDEST

gen mortality = 1 if DISCHDEST == "Expired"

replace mortality = 0 if mortality == .

tab mortality

gen survival = 1 if DISCHDEST != "Expired"

replace survival = 0 if survival == .

tab survival

rename *, upper

save "\2019", replace
